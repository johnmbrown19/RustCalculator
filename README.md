# Rust Calculator

## Introduction
This repository contains a simple calculator program written in Rust. The program performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed to demonstrate basic Rust syntax, standard input/output handling, and conditional logic.

## Features
- **Basic arithmetic operations:** Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
- **Interactive command-line interface:** Engaging user input and output.
- **Input validation:** Checks for both numbers and operators.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Rust Programming Environment:** Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can install Rust from [the official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

### Installation and Running the Program
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/johnmbrown19/RustCalculator.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

3. Build and run the program:
   cargo run

### How to Use
Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
After providing the inputs, the calculator will display the result of the operation.
